				<h1>About</h1>
				<h2>Early life</h2>
				<pre>Avril Ramona Lavigne was born in 1984 at Belleville, Ontario, Canada. She was named "Avril"
by her father after the French word for the month of April. He and Lavigne's mother recognized their child's
vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang "Jesus Loves Me" on the way home from church. Lavigne has an
older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, both of whom teased her when she sang. "My brother used
to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying." She is the
sister-in-law of Japanese band One OK Rock bassist Ryota Kohama. Lavigne's paternal grandfather Maurice Yves
Lavigne was born in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec. A member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, he married Lucie Dzierzbicki,
a French native of Morhange, in France in 1953. Their son, Jean-Claude Lavigne was born in 1954 on the RCAF
Station Grostenquin in Grostenquin, Lorraine. When Jean-Claude was a child, the family moved to Ontario, Canada,
and in 1975, he married Judith-Rosanne "Judy" Loshaw.

When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Greater Napanee, Ontario, a town with a population of
approximately 5,000. In school, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving. Her parents supported her
singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their
basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day
Worship Center in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took
her to karaoke sessions. Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, the Dixie
Chicks, and Shania Twain. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop Thinking
About You", about a teenage crush, which she described as "cheesy cute". By the age of 15, she had appeared on
stage with Shania Twain and by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more
than $2 million.</pre>
